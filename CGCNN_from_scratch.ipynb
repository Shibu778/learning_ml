        "Crystal Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (CGCNN) is a machine learning framework that predicts material properties from crystal structures using graph neural networks. CGCNN framework directly learns about the materials properties from the connection between the atoms providing a universal and interpretable representation of crystalline materials. The main idea in this approach is to represent the crystal structure by a crystal graph that encodes both atomic information and bonding interactions between atoms, and then build a convolutional neural network on top of the graph to automatically extract representations that are optimum for predicting target properties by training with DFT calculated data."

Unlike a normal graph it allows multiple edges between smae pair of end nodes to account for periodicity. Each node is represented by a feature vector $\\textbf{v}_i$, encoding the property of the atom corresponding to node $i$. Similarly, each edge $(i, j)_k$ is represented by a feutre vector $\\textbf{u}_{(i,j)_k}$, corresponding to the $k^{th}$ bond connecting atom $i$ and atom $j$."
